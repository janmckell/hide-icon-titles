Hiding the title attribute for social media icons using jquery (in WordPress)


I tried to insert the script into the header.php and that didn't work. 
I loaded the js file as an external file into the js folder in the child theme, and referenced it from the functions.php file using wp_enqueue_script and that also didn't work.

However, when on the site and I pasted the script to the console, it worked.

It also worked when I put the script into the Divi Integrations options window area inside of the 'head code' box.

All mentioned files are in this repository.
